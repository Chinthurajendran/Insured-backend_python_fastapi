# Insured Pulse - Backend

This is the backend API for the Insured Pulse application, built with **Python FastAPI**. It provides RESTful endpoints to manage insurance policies, user authentication, and other business logic. The backend is Dockerized for easy deployment and development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv`

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chinthurajendran/insured-pulse-backend.git
cd insured-pulse-backend
````

### Running Locally (without Docker)

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Running with Docker

Build and run the Docker container using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the backend server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
